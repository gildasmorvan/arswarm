multidrones is a set of bash and expect scripts to connect and configure multiple ar drones 2 (http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) on the same unencrypted network

multidrones should run on Mac OS X (Darwin) and Linux-based systems since Bash (http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html) and Expect (http://expect.sourceforge.net/) are installed.

To connect multiple ar drones, first edit the multidrones.sh file:
	Set the name of the wifi interface of your computer using the variable interface (Mac OS X: generally en0 or en1; Linux : generally eth0 or eth1).
	For instance: 
		interface=en1
	Set the list of drone ids (last 6 digits of the drone  SSIDs) to connect to using the variable ardronesnetworks. For instance:
		declare -a ardronesnetworks=(090658 290876)
	Specify the name of the unencrypted network you want to connect to using the variable network. For instance:
		network=DRONES
	By default, the wifi access point IP address is supposed to be 192.168.1.1. The IP address of the computer that runs the script will be set to 192.168.1.2.
	The drones IP addresses will be set to 192.168.1.3-x. It can be changed using the variable ip.

Then, authorize the scripts to be executed
	$chmod a+x multidrones.sh multidrones.expect


Finally, run the main script
	$./multidrones.sh

You can now control all the drones at the same time using, e.g., using the node.js ar-drone module (http://nodecopter.com/).
